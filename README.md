# searchforvowels-flask
Search for vowels in a sentence or a word, using flask

This is a small application build with the help of flask, for taking values from a user via a html form, and finding out the vovels in the sentence, and display that on another webpage.

CSS is used for designing of the page and the form(although i have no clue of what's in the css file.)

The webpages are rendered. A BASE TEMPLATE, namely - 'base.html' contains the base of the template, that gets extended by the 'entry.html' and the 'results.html' files.

Inorder to use the program, you have to install the 'Flask' module , you can use 'pip' for the installation.
Also install the 'searchforvowels' module that i have created, for succesful runnning of the program. 
You can also take help from web, on how to run the webapp.
